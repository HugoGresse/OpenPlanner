# Events and Sessions

The application manages events and their sessions, with features for filtering, exporting, and generating content.

## Key Components
- [src/events/page/sessions/list/EventSessions.tsx](mdc:src/events/page/sessions/list/EventSessions.tsx) - Main component for displaying and managing event sessions
- [src/events/page/sessions/list/filterSessions.ts](mdc:src/events/page/sessions/list/filterSessions.ts) - Session filtering logic
- [src/events/page/sessions/list/actions/exportSessionsActions.ts](mdc:src/events/page/sessions/list/actions/exportSessionsActions.ts) - Functions for exporting sessions

## Session Related Components
- [src/events/page/sessions/components/](mdc:src/events/page/sessions/components) - Session-related UI components
- [src/events/actions/sessions/](mdc:src/events/actions/sessions) - Actions for session management
- [src/events/page/sessions/list/](mdc:src/events/page/sessions/list) - Session listing and filtering

## Data Flow
1. Sessions are fetched using the `useSessions` hook from [src/services/hooks/useSessions.ts](mdc:src/services/hooks/useSessions.ts)
2. Filtering is applied based on user selections
3. Displayed sessions can be exported or used to generate content
